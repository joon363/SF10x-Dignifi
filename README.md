# Dignifi (2025 SF10x Hackathon)

**_Reentry Reimagined_**

Dignifi is a mobile platform designed to support formerly incarcerated individuals (a.k.a. re-entrant) as they reenter society â€” not just at the start, but every step of the way.  
By combining accessible technology with structured guidance and motivational tools, Dignifi helps users regain control of their journey.
